## Interests ðŸ¤¯
Here are my interest, you are welcome to DM me to discuss about these specific topics!

### Cybersecurity
But mostly privacy (GDPR, UU PDP), and more in the defense side of things (digital forensics, threat detection. etc). Don't imagine me doing crazy hacking stuff I'm not that kind of person ðŸ˜« (I'm not that good at CTF's too but I'm learning).

### Machine Learning
This is more of like a recent interest and I think it'll stay with me throughout my life... I like the math behind it! 

## Future Plans ðŸ¤“
I honestly want to build an AI/ML system to help with threat and vulnerability detection I think that'd be cool ngl.
