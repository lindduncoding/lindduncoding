## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Fidelya Fredelina \
Information Engineering \
Universitas Gadjah Mada Batch 2022

## Interests ðŸ¤¯
Here are my interest, you are welcome to DM me to discuss about these specific topics!

### Cybersecurity
I was introduced to cybersecurity from data privacy and governance (GDPR, UU PDP, HIPPA, etc). More keen to work in the defense side of things (digital forensics, threat detection, malware analysis, just to name a few). Actively learning Web Exploitation and Binary Analysis through a hands-on practice from HackTheBox and crackme's. Don't imagine me doing crazy hacking stuff I'm not that kind of person, yet! (I'm not that good at CTF's too but I'm always learning).

### IT Infrastructure
I am currently learning about setting up my own virtual home lab. I'm starting to explore containers and cloud services first because of their portability and expandibility. Afterwards I want to try self hosting using a more physical approach, like spinning up my own NAS server with secure configuration using Tailscale VPN!

### Data Engineering
Anything from setting up distributed infrastructure in the cloud to cleaning the data is fine for me. I can do analytics and business intelligence but I'd rather not. I have more experiences here than anything else.
