## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Interests ðŸ¤¯
Here are my interest, you are welcome to DM me to discuss about these specific topics!

### Cybersecurity
But mostly privacy (GDPR, UU PDP), and more in the defense side of things (digital forensics, threat detection, malware analysis etc). I'm also interested in administrating the infrastructure (cloud) in general. Don't imagine me doing crazy hacking stuff I'm not that kind of person ðŸ˜« (I'm not that good at CTF's too but I'm still learning).

### Data Engineering
Anything from setting up distributed infrastructure in the cloud to cleaning the data is fine for me. I can do analytics and business intelligence but I'd rather not :]
