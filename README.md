## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Fidelya Fredelina \

## Interests ðŸ¤¯
Here are my interests, you are welcome to DM me to discuss about these specific topics!

### Cybersecurity
I was introduced to cybersecurity from data privacy and governance (GDPR, UU PDP, HIPPA, etc). I'm more keen to work on the defense side of things (digital forensics, threat detection, malware analysis, just to name a few). Currently passionate and learning about:
- Cloud Hacking (from various Cloud Goat labs and just messing around with cloud deployment)
- Digital Forensics (from TryHackMe courses and DFIR labs)
- Binary Analysis (I'm BACK on track!)
- Web Exploitation (from HackTheBox courses)

Don't imagine me doing crazy hacking stuff I'm not that kind of person, *yet!*

### Backend/Server-side Web Development
I mostly enjoy tinkering everything on the server side. I've made various projects using Node.js and Flask. Even though I'm more comfortable working on the server side, I have some experiences with static site generation (using Jekyll) and React.js (specifially keen on 3D development using React-Three-Fiber).

### IT Infrastructure
I am passionate about setting up my own virtual home lab. I'm starting to explore containers and cloud services first because of their portability and expandibility. Afterwards I want to try self hosting using a more physical approach, like spinning up my own NAS server with secure configuration using Tailscale VPN!

### Data Engineering
Anything from setting up distributed infrastructure on the cloud to cleaning the data is fine for me. I can do analytics and business intelligence but I'd rather not. I have more experiences here than anything else, but I don't want to stay in this field.
